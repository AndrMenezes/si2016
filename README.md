# Geostatistical predictors: review and application #

> My second scientific initiation developed during the graduation of statistics under the guidance of professor 
[Diogo Rossoni](http://buscatextual.cnpq.br/buscatextual/visualizacv.do?metodo=apresentar&id=K4427847A1) 
with period of validity from Ago/2016 to July/2017. 


## Summary
In this project I studied the kriging methods under the theoretical and practical view. These methods can be used to predict
unknown values of random variables which are spatially correlated. In specific this project present the following Geostatics 
predictors: *Simple Kriging*, *Ordinary Kriging*, *Universal Kriging* and *Indicator Kriging*.
